# W â€“ Arrival and Service Events

**Objective:** Explain why arrival events generate new arrivals and which events are generated at service start.

## **(a) Why does an arrival event need to generate a new arrival event?**

- Arrival events represent **customers entering the system**.  
- To simulate a **continuous flow of customers**, each arrival event must schedule the **next arrival** based on the chosen distribution (e.g., exponential, uniform).  
- Without generating a new arrival, the simulation would **stop after the first customer**, which is unrealistic.  

**Example:**

- Customer X arrives at time 5 (event B1).  
- The simulator generates the **next arrival of X** at time 10 (B1 again) according to the arrival interval.  
- This ensures the system **continues receiving customers over time**.  

**Summary:** Arrival events create the next arrival to **model a continuous flow of customers**.

## **(b) Which event should be generated by the start of service (of a single service point)?**

- When a customer **starts service**, the system must know **when the service will finish**.  
- Therefore, the **event generated at the start of service** is the **service completion event** (C-event).  
- This event is scheduled at **current time + service time**, according to the service time distribution.  

**Example:**

- Customer X enters Operator 1 at time 6.  
- A **service completion event** is scheduled at time 10.  
- When this event occurs, the customer **leaves the system** or moves to the next step.  

**Summary:** Starting service triggers a **completion event**, so the simulator knows **when the customer finishes service**.
