# W3: Real-Life Examples of Distributions

## Task Description
Familiarize yourself with distributions used in simulation. Provide examples from real life.

## Examples

1. **Uniform Distribution**
    - All outcomes equally likely.
    - Example: Rolling a fair dice, lottery numbers.

2. **Normal Distribution**
    - Bell-shaped, mean-centered distribution.
    - Example: Heights of students, exam scores.

3. **Exponential Distribution**
    - Time between events in a Poisson process.
    - Example: Time between customer arrivals at a service desk.

4. **Poisson Distribution**
    - Number of events in a fixed interval.
    - Example: Number of phone calls received per hour.

5. **Custom Discrete Distribution**
    - Arbitrary probabilities for discrete outcomes.
    - Example: Age distribution of a student group (as in W1).

## Notes
- Distributions are used to model variability in simulations.
- Choice of distribution depends on the phenomenon being modeled.
